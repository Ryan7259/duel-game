# Duel Game
Duel is a small solo video game project written in Java for a video game architecture class. 
It was done in the span of 3 months using a bare bones game engine framework used in the class along with Blender for custom-made 3D art assets.

Since the engine was just a framework, many gameplay features were implemented such as a game loop rules, AI, networked multiplayer through LAN, a dead-zone aiming system, animations, and many more gameplay features.
